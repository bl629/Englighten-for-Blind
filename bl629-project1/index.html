      <p>Few years ago, I visited an art exhibition where I saw a sculpture by a blind “artist” with no formal art training. He made sculptures by touching the faces of people. My chat with the blind artist revealed he was born without sight and often felt dejected for not being able to see the beautiful world like other people. The exhibition left a deep impression on me and inspired me to pay more attention to blind people.</p>
      <p>To learn more about the daily experiences of blind people, I visited the Zhejiang School for the Blind with two of my friends Qinwen Meng and Li Sheng. We discovered blind children can make three-dimensional art like paper artwork and ceramics but they cannot create graphic art like painting and drawing. I had an idea to teach printmaking to children. They may carve on the cardboard and paint the carving before covering them with a paper. This process transfers the paint on the carving to the paper. It was a novel idea for blind children so we developed an “Enlighten” program to teach them. We taught them printmaking and also discussed art with them over the weekends. It was a humble attempt to lighten up their lives with art.</p>
