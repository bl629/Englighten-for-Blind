        <p class="intro">I am a freshman at Cornell University. I plan to continue teaching blind children under the Enlighten Program to bring them joy through art. My future goal is to organize an exhibition of printmaking artworks by the blind children. I also hope to help them sell their artworks to improve the financial circumstances of their families.</p>

        <p class="intro">I study at Zhejiang Institute of Economics and Trade where I am majoring in exhibition design.

      <p class="name">Li Sheng:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="intro">I study at University of Edinburgh. I came across a song titled “You are my eyes” by the blind singer Huangqi Xiao that describes the sadness of blind people as well as their desire for a better life. The song inspired me to dedicate myself to helping blind people learn more about the world. I am also committed to fighting stereotypes about blind people.</p>
