      <h3>Printmaking of Leaves</h3>

           alt="leaves" width="500" height="450"/>
      </figure>
        <p>Process:</p>
        <ol id="process">
          <li>Use a pencil to carve on the cardboard while touching the trace to remember the outline</li>
          <li>Apply the colors to the carving</li>
          <li>Put a paper on top of the carving</li>
          <li>Take off the paper</li>
          <li>Printmaking is achieved!</li>
        </ol>
      <p id="leaves">We gave a leaf to each student so that they could experience its texture by touching it. They engraved the shape and the veins of the leaf on the cardboards, painted the carvings, and pressed papers on the carvings to record the “leaves”.</p>

      <h3>Three Models of Mountains</h3>

      <p>The topic of mountain came up during one of the printmaking class sessions. The blind children had heard descriptions of mountains from other people but they still did not have a clear idea of what mountains look like. This prompted me to make three models of mountain to help them better understand what mountains look like. The first model showed a mountain as most people understand them, i.e. the mountain of phenomenology. I used an iron mesh to make the skeleton of the mountain. I took some newspapers and soaked them in lime slurry before covering the mountain with lime-soaked newspapers. I also applied a thick layer of lime to the top of the mountain. Once the newspapers had dried up, I carved details on the mountain such as ridges, valleys, and caves. The second model showed a mountain as most scientists view them, i.e. with contour lines. I create a digital model of a mountain and used laser to cut wooden boards. I assembled the wooden boards to create a rational model of a mountain. The third model showed a mountain as viewed by the artists. I chose a sketch by Vincent van Gogh, and simulated his brush strokes by putting together many layers of fake grass. This was the perceptual mountain. The three models of a mountain represented views of three different groups, i.e. ordinary people, scientists, and artists. I also reminded my students that the “real” mountain exists in the heart of each one of us.
